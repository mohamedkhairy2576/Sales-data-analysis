# Sales Data Analysis: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights üåçüìä

I‚Äôm thrilled to share my recent Sales Data Analysis project! The journey began with extracting data from a CSV file, cleaning it, and loading it into SQL Server, followed by transforming it into a Star Schema model for efficient analysis. Using Power BI, I created interactive reports across three pages: 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èRevenue & Profit by Regions**: Features a world map of revenue with profit analysis by region, where North America leads with 58.26% of shipments. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èProducts & Customers**: Highlights the top 10 best-selling products like Mountain-200 ($1.5M) with product category analysis and customer count (294 current vs. 400 target). 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èOverview**: Showcases revenue ($34M), profit ($22M), and units sold (86K) with distribution by status and regions.

### Insights from the Reports 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èFocus on Promising Markets**: North America and Europe (36.35%) are the leaders, suggesting a need to invest more in these regions. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èInventory Optimization**: Top-selling products like Mountain-200 require increased stock to meet demand. 
‚ñ∂Ô∏èCustomer Growth**: The current customer count (294) is below the target (400), calling for marketing strategies to attract more.

### Business Suggestions 
1- Expansion in Europe**: Target increased shipments based on the high percentage (36.35%) with localized promotional campaigns. 
2- Supply Chain Improvement**: Boost production of best-selling products to avoid stock shortages. 
3- Customer Loyalty Programs**: Launch a rewards program to reach the 400-customer goal, such as redeemable points. 
4- Cost Analysis**: Monitor shipping costs ($916K) to reduce unnecessary expenses.

Projects like this demonstrate the power of data analysis in driving strategic decisions. If you have any questions or want to discuss further ideas, feel free to share your thoughts! üí°
